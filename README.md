### 🩺 Diabetic Patients Dataset Analysis & Visualization

This project focuses on cleaning, exploring, and visualizing a large dataset of 100,000+ diabetic patients from different countries and races using SQL and Excel. The goal was to extract insights about patient health metrics, trends over the years, and risk factors while practicing efficient data cleaning and visualization techniques.

📊 Project Workflow

- Data Cleaning & Arrangement (SQL)
- Removed duplicates, missing & inconsistent values
- Standardized data types for BMI, blood glucose, and HbA1c levels
- Handled categorical inconsistencies (smoking habits, race, country)
- Final dataset is clean, structured, and ready for analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed min/max ranges for key metrics (BMI, blood glucose, HbA1c)
- Identified trends in diabetes prevalence over the years
- Compared health metrics across smoking habits, countries, and races
- Generated summary statistics to understand dataset distribution
- Visualization (Excel)

Built interactive dashboards with:

- 📈 Yearly trend of diabetes prevalence
- 🧪 Blood Glucose and HbA1c levels and BMI with Diabetes and Smoking Behaviour
- ⚖️ Diabetic Patients in different Races
- 🚬 Smoking habits vs. diabetes risk across races
- 🌎 Diabetes Patients Across the Globe
- 💁 Diabetic Patients in Different Gender

Included slicers and filters for Location, Year, and Gender
